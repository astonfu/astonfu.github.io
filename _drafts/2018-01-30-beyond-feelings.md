在读《Beyound Feelings》，一本经典教你批判性思维的教程。

什么是个人意志？是像宣传的那样随心所欲做自己吗？如果是这样，那就忽略了个人成长所受的外界影响，包括父母、老师、电视等。这些影响往往潜移默化，被触发时就像我们自己的一样。

而所谓个人意志不是要自己做出决定而不受影响吗？

如下过程是书里的原话，可以进行反思改变：

1. Tree your first reaction to any person, issue, or situation as tentative. No mater how appealing it may be, refuse to embrace it until after you have examined it.
2. Decide why you reacted as you did. Consider whether you borrowed the reaction from someone else —— a parent or friend, perhaps, or a celebrity or fictional character on television. If possible, determine what specific experiences conditioned you to react this way.
3. Think of other reactions your might have had to the person, issue, or situation.
4. Ask yourself whether one of the other reactions is more appropriate than your first reaction. And when you answer, resist the influence of your conditioning.
